# Miscellaneous Utilities

Have you ever wondered something like "I've built that helper or utility some
time ago, but I'm not sure how to find it now"?! ... I did (and do), which is
why I created this repo.

Have fun exploring the [`utils/`](./utils) files.

**_Hint_**: the first test of each utility is a good example how to use it

**Commands**

- `deno fmt`
- `deno test`
